# Music-Player


The music player allows the user to create albums where the user can add music to. The music can be played with volume control and seeking feature. There are also forward and backward functionality and a scramble button that scrambles the next piece of music played. Details such as song name, artist, genre and rating can be assigned to each individual music and these details can be searched to make finding a piece of music easier.
